# Car Sales Data Analysis using Power BI
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build an interactive Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI to analyze YTD sales performance, track key KPIs like total sales, average price, and cars sold, and provide insights into trends, regional performance, and company-wise growth to support data-driven business decisions.
