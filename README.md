# Car-Sales-Data-Analysis-using-Power-BI
This project is an interactive Car Sales Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze YTD sales performance, cars sold, average price, and YOY growth. It provides insights into weekly trends, regional performance, and company-wise sales. The solution uses data cleaning, modeling, and DAX time intelligence to support data-driven decisions.
